    <h1>
        Installing</h1>
    <p>
        The installation procedure is rudimentary yet still simple at this stage. All you
        need to do is run the <code>install.cmd</code> command script from the base of the location where
        you extracted Gurtle and you are done. If the script executed successfully, Gurtle
        will be available to TortoiseSVN as an issue tracker plug-in provided that you are
        running version TortoiseSVN 1.5 or later. 
        See &ldquo;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-bugtracker.html#tsvn-dug-bugtracker-ref">Getting Information from the Issue Tracker</a>&rdquo;
        in the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/">TortoiseSVN documentation</a> 
        for more information</p>
    <p>
        <em>Note:</em> You cannot install more than one version of Gurtle at the same time.
        Only the latest installed will be seen and used by TortoiseSVN.</p>
    <h2>
        Setting up Gurtle for Google Code Projects</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of Gurtle is to allow you to easily access the list of issues in your
        <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">projects hosted at Google Code</a> 
        when performing a commit using TortoiseSVN. From
        within the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-commit.html#tsvn-dug-commit-basics">Commit dialog box</a>, 
        you will be able to select one or more issues listed
        online. The number and summary of each selected issue will then be appended to your
        commit log message, serving as a cross-reference for the future.</p>
    <p>
        In order to enable access to issues for a project during commits, you need to configure
        TortoiseSVN and Gurtle together. The steps for this are already described in the
        TortoiseSVN documentation, under 
        &ldquo;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-settings.html#tsvn-dug-settings-hooks-issuetracker">Issue Tracker Integration</a>.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        When you see the <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-settings.html#tsvn-dug-settings-hooks-issuetracker">Issue Tracker Integration/Add dialog box</a>
        appear in TortoiseSVN, you will need
        to supply three pieces of information. In the <strong>Working Copy Path</strong> field, enter the
        absolute path to the working copy of your project. From the <strong>Provider</strong> list, select
        <strong>Gurtle (Google Code)</strong>. Finally, the <strong>Parameters</strong> field should contain the following
        string, where <code>PROJECT</code> should be replaced with the name of your Google Code project:</p>
    <pre>project=PROJECT</pre>
    <p>
        For example, for this project, <em>Gurtle</em>, which is located at 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/">http://code.google.com/p/gurtle/</a>,
        the <strong>Parameters</strong> field would read <code>project=gurtle</code>.
        <em>The project name is case-sensitive so you should enter it correctly,
        usually all in lower case letters.</em></p>
    <p>
        That is it. The next you are ready to commit a change pertaining to an issue, you
        should see a button with the text <strong>Select Issue</strong> appear in the 
        Commit dialog box from TortoiseSVN.</p>
    <h1>
        Uninstalling</h1>
    <p>
        To uninstall Gurtle, run the <code>uninstall.cmd</code> command script from the base of the location
        where you extracted Gurtle. Once done, you can simply delete the directory tree
        holding Gurtle.</p>
